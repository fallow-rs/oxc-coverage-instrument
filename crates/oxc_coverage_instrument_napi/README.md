# Oxc Coverage Instrument for Node.js

Istanbul-compatible JavaScript and TypeScript coverage instrumentation, built on
the [Oxc](https://oxc.rs) parser and exposed to Node.js through napi-rs.

## Overview

The `oxc-coverage-instrument` npm package wraps the native instrumenter. It
exposes instrumentation, coverage remapping, and V8-to-Istanbul conversion, plus
a ready-made adapter for Vitest's Istanbul provider and for
`vite-plugin-istanbul`.

```bash
npm install oxc-coverage-instrument
```

```javascript
import { instrument } from 'oxc-coverage-instrument';

const result = instrument(source, 'file.js', {
  coverageVariable: '__coverage__',
  sourceMap: true,
});

result.code;                                         // instrumented source
const coverageMap = JSON.parse(result.coverageMap);  // Istanbul format
result.sourceMap;                                    // source map JSON, when enabled
```

Pass `{ compat: 'istanbul' }` when replacing an existing
`istanbul-lib-instrument` instance without changing coverage denominators or
metadata shape. The profile disables Oxc's logical-assignment and optional-chain
branches, uses Istanbul's anonymous function names and method spans, and emits
its empty synthetic `else` locations. Without the profile, existing Oxc
extensions remain enabled.

## Key Features

### Vitest

Requires `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-istanbul` 4.1.5 or newer, which is where
the `coverage.instrumenter` option was added.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import { createOxcInstrumenter } from 'oxc-coverage-instrument/vitest'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'istanbul',
      instrumenter: (options) => createOxcInstrumenter(options),
    }
  }
})
```

The factory forwards `coverageVariable` and `ignoreClassMethods` to the native
instrumenter. Collection, merging, and reporting in the Istanbul provider are
untouched.

The adapter auto-detects raw TypeScript: when the filename ends in `.ts`,
`.tsx`, `.mts`, or `.cts` and no `inputSourceMap` was supplied, it runs an
in-process TypeScript-strip pass, so the output is executable JavaScript and the
coverage map points at the original `.ts` source. No `@babel/preset-typescript`
or upstream `tsc` step is needed.

Set `stripTypescript: false` when running under a toolchain that pre-transforms
TypeScript without emitting an `inputSourceMap`
(`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` in some configurations, Bun's TypeScript runner,
Node 23 and newer with `--experimental-strip-types`). Set `stripTypescript: true`
to force the strip pass regardless of filename or `inputSourceMap`.

See `examples/vitest-typescript/` in the repository for a working project.

### Legacy decorators

By default, decorator syntax (Stage 3 and legacy `experimentalDecorators` alike)
flows through the strip pass verbatim. Counters land on the surrounding class
bodies and methods, and a downstream tool (Babel, `tsc`, SWC, or native Node
decorators) lowers them at runtime.

Set `experimentalDecorators: true` on the instrument call, or on
`createOxcInstrumenter`, to lower legacy decorators in-process into
`_decorate(...)` calls. Add `emitDecoratorMetadata: true` to also emit
`_decorateMetadata("design:type", ...)`,
`_decorateMetadata("design:paramtypes", ...)`, and
`_decorateMetadata("design:returntype", ...)`. NestJS dependency injection,
TypeORM column type inference, and class-validator all read that metadata.

`createOxcInstrumenter` promotes `emitDecoratorMetadata: true` to also enable
`experimentalDecorators`, matching `tsconfig.json` semantics. The bare
`instrument()` binding rejects that combination with an `Error` instead, so the
underlying Rust `DecoratorMode` keeps invalid states unrepresentable.

With `emitDecoratorMetadata` on, `strictNullChecks` decides how a nullable union
is written into `design:type`, mirroring the `tsconfig.json` flag of the same
name. It defaults to `true`, matching `tsc` under `strict`, so `foo: string |
null` emits `Object`. Set it to `false` if your sources are compiled without
`strictNullChecks`: `null` and `undefined` are then elided from the union first
and the same property emits `String`. A mismatch is silent. The instrumented code
runs either way, but the metadata consumers above resolve a different type than
`tsc` produced.

Lowered output imports helpers from
[`@oxc-project/runtime`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-project/runtime):

```bash
npm install @oxc-project/runtime
```

`Cannot find module '@oxc-project/runtime/helpers/decorate'` at test time means
the package is missing from the consumer. Install it as a regular dependency,
not a dev dependency, so it is present wherever the instrumented code runs. The
relationship mirrors `babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata` and
`@babel/runtime` in a Babel pipeline.

### vite-plugin-istanbul

Requires `vite-plugin-istanbul` 9.0.0 or newer, which is where the
`instrumenter` option was added.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import istanbul from 'vite-plugin-istanbul'
import { createOxcInstrumenter } from 'oxc-coverage-instrument/vitest'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    istanbul({
      instrumenter: createOxcInstrumenter(),
      include: ['src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
      exclude: ['node_modules', 'test/'],
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Custom Vite or Rollup plugin

```javascript
import { instrument } from 'oxc-coverage-instrument';

export function coveragePlugin() {
  return {
    name: 'coverage-instrument',
    transform(code, id) {
      if (process.env.COVERAGE && /\.[jt]sx?$/.test(id) && !id.includes('node_modules')) {
        const result = instrument(code, id, { sourceMap: true });
        return { code: result.code, map: result.sourceMap ? JSON.parse(result.sourceMap) : undefined };
      }
    },
  };
}
```

### Remapping coverage

`remapCoverageMap` walks a coverage map through its embedded `inputSourceMap`.
Pass `{ dropUnmapped: true }` to drop statement, function, and branch entries that
fail to remap along with their `s`, `f`, `b`, and `bT` slots:

```js
import { remapCoverageMap } from 'oxc-coverage-instrument';

const remapped = JSON.parse(
    remapCoverageMap(JSON.stringify(coverageMap), { dropUnmapped: true }),
);
```

Set `composeInputSourceMap: true` alongside `inputSourceMap` on the `instrument`
call to fold the input map in eagerly instead. The coverage map is then keyed by
the original source path, carries original-source positions, and has no
`inputSourceMap`, so a later `remapCoverageMap` is a no-op.

## Architecture

The package is a napi-rs binding over `oxc_coverage_instrument`; all
instrumentation, remapping, and conversion logic lives in Rust, and the
JavaScript layer only marshals options and JSON. Coverage maps cross the boundary
as JSON strings rather than as object graphs, which keeps one serialization
format between the native and WebAssembly bindings.

### Runtime matrix

The npm package ships prebuilt native bindings for seven platforms plus two
WebAssembly fallbacks: `@oxc-coverage-instrument/binding-wasm32-wasi` for
runtimes with `SharedArrayBuffer`, and a single-threaded `wasm32-wasip1` variant
for runtimes without it. The WASM binding is selected when no matching native
binary is available, or explicitly through `NAPI_RS_FORCE_WASI`.

| Runtime | Binding | Notes |
|:--------|:--------|:------|
| Node 18+ (darwin/linux/win32, x64/arm64) | native | Preferred when a matching `.node` is installed. |
| Node 22 LTS (other architectures) | wasm | Loads via `node:wasi` and emits an experimental-feature warning. |
| Deno 2.x | wasm | Uses Deno's `node:wasi` polyfill. Live deploy smoke tracked in [#88](https://github.com/fallow-rs/oxc-coverage-instrument/issues/88). |
| Browser with COOP/COEP | threaded wasm | Imports the `browser` export and uses the `wasm32-wasip1-threads` binding when `SharedArrayBuffer` is available. Requires `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, and an ESM bundler with top-level await. webpack 4 and Parcel 1 are not supported. |
| Browser without COOP/COEP | single-threaded wasm | Falls back to the `wasm32-wasip1` binding. |
| Bun (supported targets) | native | Bun's `node:wasi` is incomplete ([oven-sh/bun#16156](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/16156)), so the native binding is used. |
| Cloudflare Workers | single-threaded wasm | Workers has no `SharedArrayBuffer`; the `browser` export selects `wasm32-wasip1`. |
| StackBlitz / WebContainer | partial | Newer WebContainer images load the wasm binding; older ones may fall through. Live smoke tracked in [#88](https://github.com/fallow-rs/oxc-coverage-instrument/issues/88). |

`examples/wasm-node/` is an end-to-end Node smoke exercising native and WASM.
`examples/cloudflare-workers/` compares Worker `FileCoverage` with native output
byte for byte, without credentials.

`NAPI_RS_FORCE_WASI` opts out of the native binding even when one is available.
Set it to `1` to prefer WASM and fall back to native if the WASM binding cannot
load, or to `error` to fail loudly instead of falling back. The variable is read
by the napi-rs 3 loader, not by this package.

Instrumentation semantics, the option reference, and the documented divergences
from `istanbul-lib-instrument` are shared with the Rust crate and live in
[its README](https://github.com/fallow-rs/oxc-coverage-instrument/blob/main/crates/oxc_coverage_instrument/README.md).
