//! Concise arrow body expansion.
//!
//! A concise arrow (`(x) => x * 2`) has no block for a coverage counter to
//! live in. Up to oxc 0.142 the parser produced one anyway, a `FunctionBody`
//! holding a single `ExpressionStatement`, both spanning the expression;
//! 0.143 models the body as a bare `Expression` instead, which traverse walks
//! as an expression, so `enter_function_body`, `enter_statement` and
//! `exit_statements` never fire for it. Coverage needs the 0.142 shape back:
//! the block is where `++cov.f[N]` goes, and the `ExpressionStatement` is what
//! earns the arrow's `statementMap` entry.
//!
//! [`wrap_concise_arrow_body`] rebuilds that shape. It runs from two places:
//!
//! - during the coverage traverse, from `enter_arrow_function_body`, on any
//!   body still concise when the arrow is entered;
//! - before the TypeScript strip pass, from
//!   [`pre_expand_concise_arrow_bodies`].
//!
//! The early pass exists because the strip pass rewrites the body of
//! `(x: number) => x as unknown as string` down to `x`, keeping only the
//! inner expression's span. Wrapping after that would record the stripped
//! span as the arrow's `fnMap` `loc` and as its statement entry, shrinking
//! both. Wrapping before it puts the span in a block the strip pass does not
//! touch, exactly as the 0.142 parser did.
//!
//! Wrapping is only half of the shape change. The block holds an
//! `ExpressionStatement`, and the `return` that keeps the arrow yielding its
//! value is formed on the way out of the coverage traverse. So the early pass
//! may only run when that traverse will follow: wrapped without it,
//! `(x) => x * 2` is emitted as `(x) => { x * 2; }` and returns `undefined`.
